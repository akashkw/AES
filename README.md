This project is an implementation of the [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (AES), built according to NIST standards as described in [FIPS Publication 197](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.197.pdf).

## Algorithm
The AES algorithm encrypts a message in fixed-size blocks using shared key of length 128, 192, or 256 bits. Based on the key size used, AES runs a number of "rounds," which each includes substitution, transposition, and mixing steps. Our implementation only employs keys of length 128 and 256 bits.

We implement the AES algorithm in ```aes.cc```. Data to encrypt or decrypt, and input and output files, are passed into the ```AES``` class's ```encrypt_this``` and ```decrypt_this``` methods via command line arguments.

We implement three classes, ```KeyMaster```, which handles everything related to the given key, including rotation, addition, and constants that rely on key length; ```EasyWord```, which performs operations on words, such as getting and setting byte values; and ```AES```, which performs encryption and decryption.

### KeyMaster

### EasyWord

### AES
The ```AES``` class performs the core of the AES algorithm. AES's ```encrypt_this``` method takes in data via its ```_vectortext``` parameter and pads the input with 0s until it reaches a length divisible by 16, creating a string of data that can be evenly split into 128 bit blocks.

Then, ```encrypt_this``` puts each block into a state matrix and performs a series of transformations on the state. Given a number of rounds (from KeyMaster), the method performs byte substitution, row shifting, column mixing, and round key adding, over and over. Finally, it performs a single round without column mixing and returns the encrypted text.

For decryption, ```decrypt_this``` also puts its input blocks into state and performs a series of (inverse) transformations on the state. Given a number of rounds, it runs inverse row shifting, inverse byte substitution, round key addition, and inverse column mixing. On its final round, it similarly performs all of the above steps without mixing columns. It then returns the decrypted text.

Each of the canonical encryption and decryption methods are commented with references to their definition and explication in the NIST technical specifications. In an effort to improve our algorithm's expedience and simplicity, many of our methods, including row shifting, byte substitution, and column mixing are hardcoded. Though normally, this design choice would be frowned upon, in this case, our algorithm works as a black box â€“ receiving input text to encrypt and decrypt and returning its results. Thus, at the top of ```aes.cc```, we define ```S_TABLE```, ```INV_S_TABLE```, and several ```mult``` arrays.  

## Running AES

Our implementation runs using a text-based user interface. To run the project, first compile the code using ```make``` and then run the executable using ```./aes``` with proper command line arguments.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:tiramisueanne/AES.git
$ cd AES
$ make
$ ./aes --keyfile <keyfile> --inputfile <inputfile> --outputfile <out> --mode <encrypt/decrypt>
```

This project was built according to the specifications detailed in the CS 361: Introduction to Computer Security [AES rubric](./misc/aes.pdf) and submitted for credit.

## Running tests

Our test suite uses Google's [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) C++ testing framework. To install Google Test on a Mac computer, follow the instructions in the [test installation README](./misc/test-install.md).

To run the tests, simply run:
```
$ make test
```
